TML BASIC user manual for the Apple IIgs

TML BASIC is a BASIC compiler for the 16-bit Apple IIgs that was syntax compatible with Apple's abandoned Apple IIGS BASIC.

At the time this repository was created, the user manual for TML BASIC had not yet been scanned and archived. 
Since then a copy has been scanned and can be found at https://archive.org/details/tmlbasicfortheappleiigs/

Prior to that, there was a set of text files of a french language translation that was distributed on two 800K floppy images.

This repository contains an english language translation of the french translation as generated by the Google Translate service.

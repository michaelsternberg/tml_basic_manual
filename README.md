TML BASIC user manual for the Apple IIgs

TML BASIC is a BASIC compiler for the 16-bit Apple IIgs that was syntax compatible with Apple's abandoned Apple IIGS BASIC.

At this time, the user manual for TML BASIC has not been scanned and archived yet (at least as far I as I can tell). There is however a set of text files of a french language translation that was distributed on two 800K floppy images.

This repository contains an english language translation of the french translation as generated by the Google Translate service. Until a scan of the original documentation becomes available, this plain text translation can be the source of a nicely typeset edition.
